Other things to note

All requests for early check-ins or late check-out will be subject to availability and may incur additional charges.

If you wish to smoke, please do so only on the terrace of the villa. An ashtray is available for your use.

The villa is located in the middle of the jungle so bugs and insects are a common sight. We do provide mosquito plugs. However, if you get scared easily with insects or bugs, this is not the right place for you and we recommend you find somewhere else to stay.

Since we are living in the midst of nature, any food (even just bread crumbs) will attract ants and other insects. Please always clean after yourselves to avoid too many earthly visitors.

The villa is very private and secluded, but there are 3 another villas next door. As all the villas are located on a hill you still have privacy.","If you want to know whether this is the right place for you, here's what you should consider:

Advantages:
- A once in a lifetime experience unlike any place you have stayed before
- it's very relaxed - if you want to escape the crowded cities and be surrounded by greenery and hear the sound of the waves, this is the place for you
- the view is incredible as you have a mix of coconut trees and the ocean;
- your hosts Chamara and Mathieu are local resident of the village. If local events take place in the village while you are here, they will be happy to share these informations with you.
- you have an in-room service for breakfast, lunch and diner;
- you have daily cleaning;

Downsides:
- As the villa is located high on a hill, you will need to take a lot of stairs to have access to the property. Our staff will be there for carrying your luggages but you still have to take it into consideration.
- Please bring sufficient cash as there is no ATM nearby
- The Diviya villa is located in the middle of nature and you will have visits of ""nature's residents"". While we keep everything very clean, you can sometimes see bugs, insects or geeko which is normal and part of the experience and cannot be avoided. That's why we ask to always clean after yourselves to avoid too many earthly visitors. If you are sensitive with this, this place is not suitable for you. If you leave the light of the terrace on over night, please don't be surprised to find dead insects on the floor in the morning - it naturally attracts them.
- There could be powercuts, as it is the case in whole Sri Lanka and we don't have a generator.",2,641de8a30fa461f4b5e5e4fc,"[""wifi"",""parking"",""first-aid"",""fire-extinguisher"",""pets"",""stay""]","[""uploads\\photo1679761017682.jpg"",""uploads\\photo1679761029219.jpg"",""uploads\\photo1679761066242.jpg""]",145,Diviya Lodge - Madiha
